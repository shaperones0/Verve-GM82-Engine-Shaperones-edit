[Get the nightly version](https://github.com/shaperones0/Verve-GM82-Engine-Shaperones-edit/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## Nightly builds
You will need following files:
* font: [Nekoron.fon](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V_09CvmPcXuXB5wOyEtHVBN93OTAsbwS/view?usp=sharing)
  * supported text sizes: 12, 18 (equals to 12), 24, 36, 48, 60, 72
* datafiles: [datafiles.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gnlEOTbU5aOgOE-GOiIv3umOJs9Vchaj/view?usp=sharing)
  * copy it over into the source folder (so the `datafiles` folder is right next to `backgrounds`, `cache` and `fonts` folder)
